The objective of this project is to enhance proficiency in manipulating large datasets, exceeding 1 million rows, using straightforward commands within a user-friendly Jupyter notebook environment. Initially, I imported essential libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy to facilitate data analysis. Upon dataset exploration, I determined the number of sheets and data elements, proceeding to rectify issues like blank rows that offer no value to the dataset. Subsequently, I addressed missing values in the price column, opting for data imputation due to the prevalence of missing values surpassing 2% of the dataset. Imputation involved estimating values for blank cells based on the distribution of the data. Given the right-skewed distribution of 'Price' values, where the mean exceeds the median, I chose to impute using the median value to mitigate the influence of outliers. Furthermore, I rectified country names with spelling errors and eliminated duplicate entries to ensure data integrity. Lastly, I merged both sheets in Excel and sorted the dataset by the country column for streamlined analysis and interpretation.
